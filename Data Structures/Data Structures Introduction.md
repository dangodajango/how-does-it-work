### Linear Data Structures:

Linear data structures are those in which data elements are arranged sequentially. This means that each element is connected to the next one in a linear fashion:
- [[Array]] - A collection of elements identified by array index or key.
- [[Linked List]] - A collection of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the sequence.
- [[Stack]] - A collection of elements with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
- [[Queue]] - A collection of elements that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of more elements at one end of the sequence and removal from the other end.
- [[Doubly Linked List]] - A [[Linked List]] in which each node contains a reference to the next node as well as the previous node in the sequence.
- [[Circular Buffers]] - A data structure that uses a single fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.
- [[Dynamic Array]] - An [[Array]] that can grow or shrink in size dynamically.

### Non-Linear Data Structures:

- [[Tree]] - A hierarchical data structure with a set of connected nodes without any cycles.
- [[Binary Tree]] - A [[Tree]] in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
- [[Binary Search Tree (BST)]] - A [[Binary Tree]] where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in all the nodes in that node's left subtree and less than the values in all the nodes in that node's right subtree.
- [[AVL Tree]] - A self-balancing [[Binary Search Tree (BST)]], the first such data structure to be invented.
- [[Red-Black Tree]] - A kind of self-balancing [[Binary Search Tree (BST)]]  where each node contains extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black.
- [[B-Tree]] - A self-balancing search [[Tree]], in which every node contains multiple keys and has more than two children.
- [[Graph]] -A collection of nodes and edges where each edge connects a pair of nodes.
- [[Directed Graph]] - A [[Graph]] where edges have a direction.
- [[Undirected Graph]] - A [[Graph]] where each edges do not have a direction.
- [[Weighted Graph]] - A [[Graph]] where each edge is assigned a weight or a cost.
- [[Hash Table]] - A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that that can map keys to values.
- [[Heap]] - A specialised tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- [[Binary Heap]] - A complete [[Binary Tree]] which is either Min [[Heap]] or Max [[Heap]].
- [[Fibonacci Heap]] - A collection of [[Tree]]s that satisfies the heap property.
- [[Tries]] - A tree-like data structure that proves to be very efficient for solving certain types of problems.
